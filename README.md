## Introduction

This project aims to predict house prices in the USA using machine learning techniques. By analyzing features like location, number of bedrooms, lot size, and various other factors, the model predicts the selling price of a house. This project helps in understanding market trends and can be used by real estate agencies or individuals to estimate property values.

## Key Features

- Predicts house prices based on various features such as:
  - Location (City/State)
  - Square footage
  - Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
  - Year built
  - Lot size
  - Proximity to amenities
- Provides data visualization to showcase trends and patterns in house prices across different states.
- Evaluates model performance using error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about houses in the USA, including features that impact pricing, such as:
- **Price**: The target variable (price of the house in USD).
- **Size**: Square footage of the house.
- **Number of Bedrooms**: The total number of bedrooms.
- **Number of Bathrooms**: The total number of bathrooms.
- **Year Built**: Year the house was constructed.
- **Location**: City and State information.
- **Lot Size**: The size of the plot on which the house is built.

### Data Preprocessing:
- **Handling missing values**: Removed or imputed any missing data.
- **Feature scaling**: Standardized the numerical features.
- **Encoding categorical variables**: Converted categorical data (e.g., city, state) into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for writing and running the code.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building and evaluating models.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization and analysis.

## Model Performance

Several machine learning algorithms were explored, including:
- **Linear Regression**: Simple yet interpretable model for predicting prices.
- **Random Forest**: A powerful ensemble method that helps in capturing non-linear relationships.
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting model for improved prediction accuracy.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Evaluates the model’s prediction accuracy.
- **R-squared**: Explains the variance in the dependent variable captured by the model.

The model with the best performance is selected based on these evaluation metrics. For example, the **Random Forest** model may achieve the best RMSE of 45,000 USD on the test set.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction-usa.git
   cd house-price-prediction-usa
   ```
